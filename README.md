## Contributing/Using

First clone the repository

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SovietKitsune/RobloxDevelopers.git
```

Next have a .env
```env

```
Make sure to fill in the field with your token

If you want hiring to work, for now you need to have the hooks in the .env
```env
scripting= 
building= 
modeling= 
animating= 
clothing= 
vfx= 
graphics= 
other= 
```

Now once they are all filled in you should be able to run
```sh
luvit main.lua
```
